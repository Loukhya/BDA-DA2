# BDA-DA2
The uploaded Jupyter Notebook appears to use a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for clustering and visualizing data from a wine dataset. Here's an outline of its content:

1. **Imports:**
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` for data normalization.
   - `MiniSom` for implementing a Self-Organizing Map.
   - Visualization tools from `pylab`.

2. **Dataset:**
   - It loads a wine dataset containing various chemical properties of different wine samples. The dataset includes attributes like alcohol content, malic acid, ash, magnesium, and more.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - The data is normalized using `MinMaxScaler` to ensure that all features are within a similar range, which is crucial for training SOMs.

4. **SOM Training:**
   - A `MiniSom` instance is created with specified grid dimensions (for clustering), and the SOM is trained on the dataset.

5. **Visualization:**
   - The SOM's results are visualized using color maps to display how the different wine samples cluster together.

Based on this, here's a draft for the README file:

# Wine Dataset Clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster a wine dataset based on various chemical properties. SOM is an unsupervised learning technique used for data visualization and clustering.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `sklearn`: For data preprocessing (normalization using `MinMaxScaler`).
- `minisom`: For implementing and training the Self-Organizing Map.
- `pylab`: For visualizing the results of the SOM.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn minisom matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The dataset contains chemical analysis of wines grown in a specific region. The attributes include:

- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is normalized using the `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` to bring all features within a 0-1 range.

2. **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**:
   - A `MiniSom` instance is created to map the high-dimensional wine data to a 2D grid.
   - The SOM is trained over multiple iterations to create a topological map of the wine data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - A heatmap is generated to show the SOM clustering, where different regions on the map correspond to different types of wines based on their chemical properties.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Notebook**: Load the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially to see how the SOM clusters the wine data.
2. **Modify Parameters**: You can adjust the size of the SOM grid or the number of training iterations to experiment with different clusterings.
3. **Visualize**: The final cell will display a visual representation of the SOM clusters.
