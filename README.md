# BDA-DA2
The uploaded Jupyter Notebook appears to use a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for clustering and visualizing data from a wine dataset. Here's an outline of its content:

1. **Imports:**
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` for data normalization.
   - `MiniSom` for implementing a Self-Organizing Map.
   - Visualization tools from `pylab`.

2. **Dataset:**
   - It loads a wine dataset containing various chemical properties of different wine samples. The dataset includes attributes like alcohol content, malic acid, ash, magnesium, and more.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - The data is normalized using `MinMaxScaler` to ensure that all features are within a similar range, which is crucial for training SOMs.

4. **SOM Training:**
   - A `MiniSom` instance is created with specified grid dimensions (for clustering), and the SOM is trained on the dataset.

5. **Visualization:**
   - The SOM's results are visualized using color maps to display how the different wine samples cluster together.

Based on this, here's a draft for the README file:

# Wine Dataset Clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster a wine dataset based on various chemical properties. SOM is an unsupervised learning technique used for data visualization and clustering.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `sklearn`: For data preprocessing (normalization using `MinMaxScaler`).
- `minisom`: For implementing and training the Self-Organizing Map.
- `pylab`: For visualizing the results of the SOM.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn minisom matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The dataset contains chemical analysis of wines grown in a specific region. The attributes include:

- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is normalized using the `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` to bring all features within a 0-1 range.

2. **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**:
   - A `MiniSom` instance is created to map the high-dimensional wine data to a 2D grid.
   - The SOM is trained over multiple iterations to create a topological map of the wine data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - A heatmap is generated to show the SOM clustering, where different regions on the map correspond to different types of wines based on their chemical properties.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Notebook**: Load the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially to see how the SOM clusters the wine data.
2. **Modify Parameters**: You can adjust the size of the SOM grid or the number of training iterations to experiment with different clusterings.
3. **Visualize**: The final cell will display a visual representation of the SOM clusters.

Here are the steps on how to execute the Jupyter Notebook file:

# How to Execute the Jupyter Notebook

This section will guide you through the steps required to run the `wines_som.ipynb` file in your local environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**  
   You can install Jupyter using pip if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. **Required Python Libraries**  
   The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
   - `pandas`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `minisom`
   - `matplotlib`

   Install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn minisom matplotlib
   ```

## Steps to Run the Notebook

### 1. Clone or Download the Notebook

- **Download**: If you have the `.ipynb` file, you can directly place it in a directory of your choice.
- **Clone the Repository**: If it's hosted on a version control system (e.g., GitHub), you can clone the repository.

### 2. Open Jupyter Notebook

- Launch Jupyter Notebook in your terminal by navigating to the directory containing the notebook file and running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

- This will open a browser window showing the list of available notebooks in that directory.

### 3. Load the Notebook

- In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, navigate to the location where `wines_som.ipynb` is saved.
- Click on the file name to open the notebook.

### 4. Execute the Notebook

- Once the notebook is open, you can execute it cell by cell:
   - Click on the first cell and then press `Shift + Enter` to run it.
   - Keep pressing `Shift + Enter` to run each subsequent cell.

Alternatively, you can run all cells at once:
- From the menu bar, click on `Cell` and then select `Run All` to execute the entire notebook.

### 5. View the Results

- After running the cells, the notebook will generate visualizations and output based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) applied to the wine dataset.
- These visualizations will show clusters and mappings of the dataset's features.

## Additional Notes:

- If you wish to modify or experiment with the parameters (e.g., SOM grid size or the number of iterations), you can adjust the parameters in the respective cells before executing them.
- For a fresh execution, you can restart the kernel by selecting `Kernel -> Restart & Run All`.
